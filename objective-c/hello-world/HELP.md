## Running the tests

There are two different methods of getting set up to run the tests with Objective-C:

- Create an Xcode project with a test target which will run the tests.
- Use the ruby gem `objc` as a test runner utility.

Both are described in more detail here: https://exercism.io/tracks/objective-c/tests

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit HelloWorld.m HelloWorld.h` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
