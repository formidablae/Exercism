# Ordinal Number

Welcome to Ordinal Number on Exercism's PHP Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Write a function to convert normal numbers to [ordinal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_numeral). For zero (0) just return "0" as string.

Ordinal number are numbers that describe the position of something in a list.
It is this context that ordinal numbers will be used, using an English-spelled name of an ordinal number.

The ordinal numbers are (at least, one form of them):

```
1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th... 9th 10th 11th 12th... 20th 21st 22nd 23rd 24th... etc.
```

So entering a normal number results in its ordinal equivalent:

```
1 -> 1st
2 -> 2nd
3 -> 3rd
(and so on...)
```
